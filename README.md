Steps to Create a Power BI Dashboard:

Data Collection and Extraction:

Identify and gather all necessary data sources (e.g., sales transactions, cost data, customer information, product details, segment classifications). This data often comes from databases (SQL, Excel, CSV, cloud data warehouses like Azure, AWS, Google Cloud).
Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL - Extract, Transform, Load):

Extract: Load data into Power BI Desktop.
Transform: Use Power Query Editor to clean, reshape, and prepare the data. This involves:
Handling missing values.
Correcting data types (e.g., ensuring dates are recognized as dates, numbers as numbers).
Removing duplicates.
Unpivoting/Pivoting tables as needed.
Creating calculated columns (e.g., "Profit" from "Sales" and "COGS").
Merging/Appending queries from different tables.
Load: Load the transformed data into the Power BI data model.
Data Modeling:

Define Relationships: Establish relationships between different tables (e.g., Sales table to Product table, Sales table to Date table) using common keys. This ensures data flows correctly across visuals.
Create Measures (DAX - Data Analysis Expressions): Write DAX formulas to create key performance indicators (KPIs) and complex calculations not directly available in the raw data. Examples for this dashboard would include:
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
Total Gross Sales = SUM(Sales[Gross Sales Amount])
Total COGS = SUM(Sales[COGS Amount])
Total Profit = [Total Sales] - [Total COGS]
Sales YOY = DIVIDE( ([Total Sales (Current Year)] - [Total Sales (Previous Year)]), [Total Sales (Previous Year)] ) (This would involve more complex DAX for time intelligence).
LTV:CAC Ratio = [Lifetime Value] / [Customer Acquisition Cost] (These base measures would also need to be defined).
Visualization Design:

Choose Appropriate Visuals: Select the right chart types to represent the data effectively (e.g., line charts for trends over time, bar charts for comparisons, gauge charts for KPI targets, tables for detailed breakdowns).
Layout and Placement: Arrange visuals logically on the canvas for easy understanding, typically following a flow from high-level summaries to detailed breakdowns.
Formatting and Styling: Apply colors, fonts, titles, and backgrounds to make the dashboard aesthetically pleasing and consistent with branding.
Interactivity: Add filters (slicers) for Country, Product, Segment, etc., to allow users to dynamically explore the data.
Refinement and Testing:

Review: Check all calculations and visuals for accuracy.
User Feedback: (If applicable) Get feedback from potential users to ensure the dashboard meets their analytical needs and is user-friendly.
Performance Optimization: Ensure the dashboard loads quickly and is responsive.
Publishing and Sharing:

Publish the report to the Power BI Service.
Set up data refresh schedules.
Share with relevant stakeholders, either directly or through Power BI apps.
